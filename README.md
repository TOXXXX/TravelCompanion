## Introduction

Our website is a forum for travel enthusiasts where users can share their 
travel routes & plans as well as discovering & commenting on travel routes of others.
It also help users find travel companions by matching users that have overlapping 
travel plans.<br />
Travel routes are meant to be hypothetical or based on past travel experiences. 
They are for sharing and referencing purposes. Other users can comment on or "like" 
the travel route posts. This allows users to perfect their schemes with each other's help
and learn from each other's experiences.<br />
Travel plans are what users intend to carry out in the future. This gives the
basis on which our Companion Discovery Page recommend travel companions to users.
Basically, it would recommend users that would be around the same place at around 
the same time to each other based on their travel plans. The comment section under
travel plan also serves as an on-site communication method for users. <br />
We also provide personal page function for users to keep a record of and showcase their 
travel ideas and experiences.
